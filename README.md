Breast Cancer Prediction using machine learning classification models (SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest) on structured medical data from the UCI dataset. Helps predict the likelihood of breast cancer based on patient features like age, symptoms, and test results.

# 🩺 Breast Cancer Prediction

Predict the likelihood of breast cancer using machine learning classification models on structured medical data.

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project applies supervised learning techniques to classify patients as having benign or malignant tumors based on features like age, symptoms, and blood test results.

## 📦 Dataset
- **Source**: [Ms. Nancy Al Aswad,kaggle Breast Cancer Dataset],[(https://https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nancyalaswad90/breast-cancer-dataset/data]

## 🤖 Algorithms Used
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Decision Tree

## 💡 Features
- Clean and structured preprocessing pipeline
- Model training, evaluation, and comparison
- Accuracy, confusion matrix, and performance metrics

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/firoz45/breast-cancer-prediction.git
cd breast-cancer-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
📈 Results
Models are evaluated based on accuracy and other classification metrics. The goal is to aid early detection of breast cancer using reliable ML tools.
